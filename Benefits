<h1> Benefits of Used Cars </h1>

<h2> 
There are many benefits to buying a used car, 
not all used cars are junk like some think. The first 
benefit of buying cars used is that they are typically 
much less than any new car at a dealership. While the 
car may not be in peek condition, it is still a great deal 
as long as there is no need to sink much money into it.

With most used cars you are able to negotiate a payment 
plan which will work best for you, the costumer. 
Used cars are great for starter cars for those who are old 
enough to drive, yet too young to make large car payments. 
If chosen correctly, a used car can last until it is time to 
buy a new car. I personally have purchased a 
used car with low miles and that is in amazing condition. 
I expect this car to last me for ten years or more until I want or have the need for a new vehicle.
